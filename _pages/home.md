The National Institute of Artificial Intelligence addresses the critical challenges of implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in alignment with human values. Emphasizing transparency, privacy, security, responsibility, reliability, fairness, and explainability, the IAIA seeks to ensure that AI systems are both comprehensible and trustworthy. It delves deep into technical challenges, such as handling diverse and complex data sets, ensuring robustness against noise and bias, and developing innovative model structures. Beyond the technical realm, the IAIA also focuses on the importance of data collection, integration, and the continuous training of professionals in the ever-evolving landscape of AI. The goal is to facilitate responsible AI that benefits society while minimizing risks.

An emblem of our commitment to collective growth and shared knowledge, the institutions we partner with embody the collaborative spirit of the IAIA.
